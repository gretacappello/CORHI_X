# CORHI_X
CORHI-X is a tool enables you to explore spacecraft constellations, visualize instrument fields of view, check data availability for coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and propagate either a catalog of CMEs or your own CME data. We hope this tool helps you explore heliospheric events with ease!
