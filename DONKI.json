Another possible source of the CME was an eruption on the NE of STA EUVI 195 at around 03:35Z also seen as opening field lines in AIA 171/193. Upon further analysis, it was determined that the most likely source was the eruption beyond the limb because the potential source identified on the face-facing disc was more northern, thus the fit between C2/C3 and COR2A did not matching well.","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"LE","dataLevel":"0","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","imageType":"running difference","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2021-07-22T17:09Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/17357/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-07-20T20:01Z","latitude":26.0,"longitude":-43.0,"halfAngle":29.0,"speed":971.0,"type":"C","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-07-20T16:48:00-CME-001","note":"","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"null","dataLevel":"1","measurementTechnique":"null","imageType":"null","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2021-07-21T18:21Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/17347/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-07-21T03:35Z","latitude":19.0,"longitude":53.0,"halfAngle":12.0,"speed":443.0,"type":"S","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-07-20T20:00:00-CME-001","note":"SWPC_CAT analysis using C2 and COR2A measurements.

The longitude of 0 deg. is based mostly on the appearance of CME as a symmetrical (southern) halo in SOHO LASCO C2. The fitting in SWPC CAT indicated higher latitude than the lat of the source (AR 2887 at S26W04) and of associated flare. Fitting suggested a higher half-width than the default 45 deg. and 49 deg produced a decent fit.","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"LE","dataLevel":"0","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","imageType":"running difference","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2022-09-22T00:55Z","versionId":5,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/18107/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-10-29T22:44Z","latitude":-40.0,"longitude":98.0,"halfAngle":18.0,"speed":966.0,"type":"C","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-10-29T19:24:00-CME-001","note":"","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"LE","dataLevel":"0","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","imageType":"running difference","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2021-10-30T18:49Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/18131/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-10-31T16:22Z","latitude":0.0,"longitude":-34.0,"halfAngle":30.0,"speed":435.0,"type":"S","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-10-31T08:36:00-CME-001","note":"","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"null","dataLevel":"1","measurementTechnique":"null","imageType":"null","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2021-11-02T01:13Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/18157/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-11-01T07:04Z","latitude":-25.0,"longitude":48.0,"halfAngle":47.0,"speed":657.0,"type":"C","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-11-01T02:00:00-CME-001","note":"","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"null","dataLevel":"1","measurementTechnique":"null","imageType":"null","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2021-11-01T23:39Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/18154/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-11-01T23:59Z","latitude":11.0,"longitude":154.0,"halfAngle":25.0,"speed":405.0,"type":"S","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-11-01T12:48:00-CME-001","note":"","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"null","dataLevel":"1","measurementTechnique":"null","imageType":"null","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2021-11-04T02:41Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/18203/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-11-02T01:20Z","latitude":-30.0,"longitude":32.0,"halfAngle":32.0,"speed":509.0,"type":"C","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-11-01T18:38:00-CME-001","note":"This SWPC_CAT measurement matched the leading-edge of the CME visible in STEREO A COR2 and SOHO LASCO C2/C3 difference imagery.","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","featureCode":"null","dataLevel":"1","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","imageType":"running difference","tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":11.0,"submissionTime":"2021-11-02T18:01Z","versionId":2,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/18172/-1"},{"time21_5":"2021-11-02T02:00Z","latitude":-19.0,"longitude":43.0,"halfAngle":49.0,"speed":771.0,"type":"C","isMostAccurate":true,"associatedCMEID":"2021-11-01T21:36:00-CME-001","note":"This SWPC_CAT measurement matched leading-edge of the CME visible in STEREO A COR2 and SOHO LASCO C3.
